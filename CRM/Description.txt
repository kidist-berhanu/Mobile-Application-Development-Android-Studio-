A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle. It centralizes customer information, streamlines sales processes, automates marketing efforts, and enhances customer service through tools like contact management, sales tracking, marketing automation, and support ticketing. By integrating with other business applications and offering advanced analytics and reporting, a CRM system helps businesses build stronger relationships with customers, increase sales, improve marketing effectiveness, and make data-driven decisions, ultimately driving growth and customer satisfaction.
